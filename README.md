Data cleaning is an important part of any data analysis. 
It involves identifying any inaccuracies in a dataset and then fixing them before jump straight into analyzing data.
## Nashville Housing Data
I used Nashville Housing market data to standardize date formats, fillmissing property addresses,
and break down address details for precision. 
I also made data more reader-friendly by changing "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No." 

## Result
These steps guarantee the accuracy and consistency of my dataset for meaningful analysis.
